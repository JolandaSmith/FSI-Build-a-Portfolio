      <p>I graduated from Old Dominion University in 2017 with a Bachelor's of Science Degree in Criminal Justice. I have worked numerous jobs in Corrections since then. I currently work as a Transportation Officer for U.S Immigration and Customs(ICE). Since the pandemic my job tasks have been very limited. I began searching for jobs online and Software Development caught my eye. These jobs interested me the most because of the starting salaries and the demand.
        I joined Old Dominion University digital skills intro course to attempt to challenge myself. My goal is to combine my degree and certification and secure a career in Cybersecurity.
